# beautifulsoup-challenge
 This challenge consisted of two parts:
 In part 1, we used Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape headlines and teasers from a Mars news website.
 We saved the results to a list and exported it into a JSON file.
 
In part 2, we started by using Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape a table of Mars temperature data.
We saved the scraped data to a list that we then converted into a Pandas dataframe.
After determining the number of months on Mars, we found and plotted the average temperature by month.
We then found and plotted the average air pressure by month.
Our final plot showed the lowest observed temperature for every day in the dataset.
Our final step was saving the dataframe as a CSV.

I used in-class examples for most of my code.
I enlisted ChatGPT to help me with the loop in part 1 that stored all the article names and descriptions.
It also helped me with the loop to scrape the table data in part 2.
I found the code for the JSON export on Stack Overflow.
I referred back to this pandas cheat sheet for the dataframe work:
https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf
And refreshed myself on matplotlib by reading their official documentation.
